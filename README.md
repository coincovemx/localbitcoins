# LocalBitcoins API Gem 0.0.4

This gem provides a simple, extensible Ruby wrapper to access the [LocalBitcoins API](https://localbitcoins.com/api-docs/). 
This repository is a fork of the gem started by [John Shutt](https://github.com/pemulis/localbitcoins).

## Installation & Setup 

Install the gem:
```
gem install localbitcoins
```

Or include it in your Gemfile:
```
gem 'localbitcoins'
```

You can use the gem with or without OAuth2 for authentication. Without authentication the API only allows access to the public endpoints documented [here (Ad Listings)](https://localbitcoins.com/api-docs/public/) and [here (Market Data)](https://localbitcoins.com/api-docs/#toc7)

### Setting Up The Client 

For authenticated requests to the LocalBitcoins API, you must [register your application](https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/api/) and get your API credentials. Use the Client ID and Client Secret to receive an access token via OAuth2. There are a number of ways to implement OAuth2, and it is largely left up to you to decide how to do it. If you've never used OAuth2 before, reading [this tutorial](http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/07/29/1/oauth2-simplified) is a good place to start!

Once you have your token, you can get to setting up the LocalBitcoins client.

``` ruby
# Authenticated

# long version
client = LocalBitcoins::Client.new(
  client_id:     'CLIENT_ID',
  client_secret: 'CLIENT_SECRET',
  oauth_token:   'OAUTH_TOKEN'
)
# slightly shorter version
client = LocalBitcoins.new(
  client_id:     'CLIENT_ID',
  client_secret: 'CLIENT_SECRET',
  oauth_token:   'OAUTH_TOKEN'
)

# Unauthenticated
client = LocalBitcoins.new

```

### Global Configuration

To make things easier, you can define your client credentials at a global level:

``` ruby
# Set the configuration
LocalBitcoins.configure(
  client_id: 'CLIENT_ID',
  client_secret: 'CLIENT_SECRET'
)

# Get the configuration
LocalBitcoins.configuration # => { client_id => 'CLIENT_ID', client_secret => 'CLIENT_SECRET' }

# Reset the configuration
LocalBitcoins.reset_configuration
```

If you're using Rails, you can set the configuration with an initializer file in `config/initializers`.

REMEMBER: Keep your client credentials secret! Do not include them in git repos, or place them anywhere that users can see them. If you suspect that your credentials have been accessed by someone else, immediately reset your client secret from your LocalBitcoins Apps Dashboard.

There are several ways to solve the problem of keeping your credentials secret. For Rails apps, I like to store them as environment variables and access them with [figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro).

## Usage

Nearly every endpoint found [in the documentation](https://localbitcoins.com/api-docs) is supported by this gem.

### Ads

Return a list of the token owner's ads with the following method:

``` ruby
ads = client.ads

ads.ad_list.each do |a|
  a.data.visible    # => boolean value of the ad's visibility
  a.data.email      # => valid e-mail string or null
  a.data.location_string # => human-readable location
  # and many more pieces of data!
end
```
Create a new ad for the token owner:

``` ruby
# - Required fields -
# min_amount                - minimum amount for sale in fiat [string]
# max_amount                - maximum amount for sale in fiat [string]
# price_equation            - price using price equation operators [string]
# lat                       - latitude of location [float]
# lon                       - longitude of location [float]
# city                      - city of listing [string]
# location_string           - text representation of location [string]
# countrycode               - two letter countrycode [string]
# account_info              - [string]
# bank_name                 - [string]
# sms_verification_required - only receive contacts with verified phone numbers [boolean]
# track_max_amount          - decrease max sell amount in relation to liquidity [boolean]
# trusted_required          - only allow trusted contacts [boolean]
# currency                  - three letter fiat representation [string]
#
# pass a hash of the above fields
# returns a message on success
client.create_ad(params)
```

Update existing ad for the token owner

``` ruby
# - Required Fields -
# id             - id of the ad you want to update
# visibility     - the ad's visibility [boolean]
# price_equation - equation to calculate price [string]
#
# NOTE 1: Setting min_amount or max_amount to nil will unset them.
# NOTE 2: "Floating price" must be false in you ad's edit form for price_equation to go through
#
# pass a hash of the above fields, plus any other editable fields
# returns a message on success
client.update_ad(id,params)
``` 

List of ads from a comma separated string of ids
``` ruby
# pass a comma separated string of ids
ads = client.ad_list("12345,123456,1234567")
``` 
Gets a single ad from its id

``` ruby
ad = client.ad(12345)
```
### Escrows

View token owner's releasable escrows
NOTE: This endpoint is not documented by LocalBitcoins and may or may not work.
``` ruby
escrows = client.escrows
# escrows are listed in escrows.escrow_list
```
Release an escrow

``` ruby
# pass the id of the contact which the escrow is associated with
# returns a complimentary message if the escrow successfully released
release = client.escrow_release(contact_id)
```

### Contacts

List of active contacts
``` ruby
# This method can filter contacts by contact_type, which can be "buyer" or "seller"
#
# buyers and sellers
contacts = client.active_contacts
# buyers only
contacts = client.active_contacts('buyer')
# sellers only 
contacts = client.active_contacts('seller')
```

Released, canceled, and closed contacts have their own methods as well, which can be filtered the same as above.
``` ruby
released = client.released_contacts
closed = client.closed_contacts
canceled = client.canceled_contacts
``` 

Get a contact based on the id
``` ruby
released = client.released_contacts
closed = client.closed_contacts
canceled = client.canceled_contacts
```

``` ruby
contact = client.contact_info(1234)
```

``` ruby
contacts = client.contacts_info("1234,12345,1234567")
# access list at contacts.contact_list
```

``` ruby
client.create_contact(ad_id, amount, message)
